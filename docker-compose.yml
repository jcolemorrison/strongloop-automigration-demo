    # mount our current directory (code) to the container's /usr/src/api

    # the default command unless we pass it one

  # ADD HERE.  This is what our MySQL service shall be known as
  mysqlDb:

    # This is the official MySQL 5.6 docker image
    image: mysql:5.6

    # These are required variables for the official MySQL image
    environment:

    # Keep it mapped to the usual MySQL port
